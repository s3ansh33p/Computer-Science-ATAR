## About

This project is apart of my Computer Science course and is the final programming assessment.
The task is to create a web or desktop game that supports multiplayer.
I have decided to create a FPS game working with [Three.JS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).
I am taking inspiration from CS:GO for this project in terms of the UI.
